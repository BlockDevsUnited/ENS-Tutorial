### Introduction

The ENS, Ethereum Naming Service, is a decentralized naming service on Ethereum, built using smart contracts. The ENS creates human-readable names for Ethereum addresses and other content.

### Hands on Tutorial

This tutorial will teach you how to interact with the ENS, and then integrate ENS functions into a simple front end Dapp.

A fully working sample Dapp is included.

1) Register your ENS domain name
2) Build front end
3) Build smart contract
4) Build Dapp


install metamask
create a wallet
go to ropsten test network
get testnet ether (click deposit, then Test faucet)

To Register an ENS domain name, go to app.ens.domains.
- search a name
- Detailed instructions on the website will walk you through name registration
- Register a domain, e.g. toothbrush.eth
- Once you have registered the domain name, you can do the following

* Set the resolver (The smart contract which translates names into addresses)
    It's easiest to just use the default resolver and click save
* Set the address (Ethereum address which the domain points to)
* Set a Reverse Record (allowing you to translate the above address back into the name)
* Transfer Registration (Transfer ownership of the domain)
* Set the controller (Transfer admin privileges to another address)
* Register subdomains, e.g. abc.toothbrush.eth and abcd.toothbrush.eth
