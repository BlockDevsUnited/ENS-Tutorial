### ENS Tutorial
### Introduction
The ENS, Ethereum Naming Service, is a decentralized naming service on Ethereum, built using smart contracts. The ENS creates human-readable names for Ethereum addresses and other content. https://ethgasstation.info/blog/what-is-ens/

### Hands on Tutorial
This tutorial will teach you how to interact with the ENS, and then integrate ENS functions into a simple front end Dapp.

A fully working sample Dapp is included.

### Objectives
Register your ENS domain name
Build front end
Build smart contract
Build Dapp
install metamask create a wallet go to ropsten test network get testnet ether (click deposit, then Test faucet)

### Getting Started
To Register an ENS domain name, go to app.ens.domains.

Search the name you want for your domain

Detailed instructions on the website will walk you through name registration

Register a domain, e.g. toothbrush.eth

Once you have registered the domain name, you can do the following

Set the resolver (The smart contract which translates names into addresses) It's easiest to just use the default resolver and click save

Set ENS records
address (Ethereum address which the domain points to)

other addresses (Other cryptocurrency addresses the domain points to)

content (IPFS hash the domain points to)

text (text content the domain points to)

Set a Reverse Record (allowing you to translate an Ethereum address back into the name)

Transfer Registration (Transfer ownership of the domain)

Set the controller (Transfer admin privileges to another address)

Register subdomains, e.g. abc.toothbrush.eth and abcd.toothbrush.eth

Test your domain registration by sending ether to your new domain name using Metamask.
